As mentioned in the previous post, here's another twisted tale of telephony.

First, the disclaimer: Unlike other incidents on this blog, this one is not autobiographical. It happened with three guys whose identity shan't be revealed. Being trustworthy has many benefits in the long run.

Three twenty some-things, born and brought up in India, gathered in Las Vegas. Let's name the three characters as LK (Logical Kamina), CB (Confused Bhola) and DA (Devil's Advocate).

LK stays in India and was on a three-week business trip to California. LK and CB had studied together in a reputed institute of India while DA and CB were doing their MS degree together in a reputed institute of USA. CB was the common friend and it was he who planned the two-day trip to Vegas in honor of LK's short visit.

Apart from having good-natured fun, adventure and gambling in the sin-city, the idea (as must be expected given the group's demographical attributes and the geography they were in) was to do something "sexy" (a refinement of their terminology; they called it chamdigiri).

LK is a pompous fellow and had already announced to the world that he was going to Vegas. Everyone in his circle naturally assumed that he would at least visit a strip-bar and so it became a self-fulfilling prophecy. It would have been foolish, according to LK, to take the blame and still not commit the crime. You have to hand him some points there. But let's also keep in mind for the rest of the post that LK has been brought up quite well in a very traditional family.

CB, like most of the engineering student, was still a virgin and not very proud of the fact; however he was a good boy with a good heart. He has a wavering mind and can get carried away in his weak moments.

I don't know much about DA apart from his role in this episode and hence the name. He was single mindedly focused on getting laid in Vegas and that was the reason he was on the trip, despite not being a close friend of LK.

Let's jump straight to their hotel room when they were about to plan that something "sexy". Of course, they have been discussing and researching it since days, but now was the time to act.

"We have three options: 1. Go to a nightclub, patao drunken girls, do some grinding and may be more. 2. Get a Lap-Dance in a Strip Club 3. Call a hooker." LK summarized the problem efficiently.

"Let's do 1 first and then we'll do the third" DA was in the mood to live life to the fullest. The reason for him not including the second point was the budget constraint put on the "sexy" task before the trip began.

"I can't do point number one. 24 saal me ek desi to pati nahi, ek raat me gori kahan se pategi" CB was brutally honest here.

"I agree with CB. Mujh se bhi nahi hoga point one." LK had no delusions either.

"Ok, then let's call the hooker. No point wasting time." DA didn't like the structured approach taken for the purpose.

"Naa. Raani nahi yaar. We'll just take a Lap-dance and that's it. Full-fledged thoda jyada ho jayega" the traditionally brought up LK voiced his reluctance.

("Raani" is an intentional typo here. Call me a hypocrite if you will, but to me, expletives and swear-words in Hindi sound much more horrible than in English.)

"Who is going to know? What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas." DA tried to persuade using conventional wisdom. He was distraught at the stand being taken.

"I agree with LK. Having paid-sex doesn't feel right. Lap-dance is a good compromise" CB continued with the analytical tone.

"Majority wins. I am going to bathe and then we'll all go to the 'Rebecca's Palace' across the street for the Lap-dance." LK was relieved at CB's support, and closed the discussion.

As LK finished his bath and walked into the room, he saw the pale face of CB and a nervous smile on DA.

"He called the hooker. Teeno ke liye ek hee mangaayi hain" CB was quick to offload the guilt. Clearly DA had attacked the still-a-virgin weak point of CB and got him to agree in LK's absence.

"Abe, why did you agree!! Aur TEEN ke liye EK. Imagine how we would do it. Taking turns into the room?? How filthy can you get!!" LK was extremely annoyed.

"Per-head one was getting out of budget constraint." said CB.

"I don't care. I am not participating. I am going alone to Rebecca's. You two do what you want to." LK made his point clear.

Within minutes, CB was back on LK's side. DA couldn't afford the cost alone. So they decided to call it off. So as to not bruise DA's ego further, it was decided that CB would have to call up the agency and cancel the service.

"Do it quick. She would ask for money if she gets here" LK was strict on CB.

"Kya bolke manaa karun?" CB posed a valid question; not many have any answers to it. For an inexperienced bunch in a foreign territory, it was all the more difficult.

"You just call and say whatever comes to your mind at that time" LK, the wisest amongst the three, said.

CB rang up the number and came up with this gem: **"Hello! Actually our parents are also coming here. Please don't come."**

LK and DA were in tears within seconds. Only a true son of soil, from the land where once Shravana was born, could have come up with that excuse.

CB didn't lose his virginity that night, but all three had great fun at Rebecca's. More importantly, they have ensured sound sleep without any worries for Indian ladies whose worse half would be traveling to Vegas. By now the word must have traveled through the escort services there and all the Indians must have been blacklisted.
