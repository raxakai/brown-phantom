Enter the number of attendees, average salary, and meeting duration. See how much your company is burning while everyone "aligns on priorities."

**Features:**
- Preset salary levels for quick calculation
- One-time, weekly, or daily meeting frequency
- Yearly cost projection for recurring meetings
- Fun equivalents (how many Zomato orders, Netflix months, etc.)
- Commentary calibrated to your organization's dysfunction level

**Formula:** (Monthly salary ÷ 22 days ÷ 8 hours ÷ 60 min) × attendees × duration

**Disclaimer:** This doesn't include context switching, post-meeting recovery time, or the existential dread of seeing another calendar invite.
