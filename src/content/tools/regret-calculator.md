Enter any past purchase - that TV, that watch, that impulsive gadget - along with when you bought it.

The calculator shows what that money would be worth today if you had invested it in an index fund instead.

**Features:**
- Adjustable return rates (10%, 12%, 15%)
- Automatic Lakhs/Crores formatting
- Commentary calibrated to your level of regret

**Disclaimer:** Past returns don't guarantee future results. But past purchases definitely guarantee present regret.
