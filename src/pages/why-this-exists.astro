      <div class="prose">
        <p>
          Between 2006 and 2010, I wrote. Not professionally, not prolifically, but persistently.
          Stories about friends, observations about life, experiments with fiction. About 80 posts
          in total. Then I stopped.
        </p>

        <p>
          The usual reasons applied. Work got busy. Life happened. The blog sat there,
          gathering digital dust, while I gathered the other kind.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fifteen years later, AI happened.
        </p>

        <p>
          Suddenly, I could make songs. Generate images. Build tools without the usual friction.
          The creative impulse that had been dormant stirred again. But this time, with
          collaborators that never sleep, never judge, and occasionally produce something
          brilliant for entirely the wrong reasons.
        </p>

        <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Notes</strong> — Stories, observations, experiments. Some excavated from 2008,
          some written last week. The old posts come with a small note acknowledging their age.
          I've resisted the urge to over-edit them. The cringe is part of the archive.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Small Machines</strong> — Tools I've built. Finance calculators, random utilities,
          experiments that solved a problem I had. Some might be useful to you. Some exist only
          because I wanted to see if they could.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Embedded Things</strong> — Songs live on YouTube. Images on Instagram.
          When relevant, they'll appear in the notes. I'm not trying to build a media empire.
          I'm trying to document what happens when you let AI help explain your failures.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>The Thesis</h2>

        <p>
          Everything I've ever written circles the same theme:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          The gap between how clever we think we are and how life actually behaves.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          AI doesn't change this. AI simply becomes another character that overpromises
          and underdelivers. Like the rest of us.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>The Voice</h2>

        <p>
          I am not an AI evangelist. I am not an AI skeptic. I am not an AI explainer.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am a slightly annoyed collaborator who suspects the machine is trying too hard.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you've read this far, you might enjoy what's here. If not, that's fine too.
          I document the predictable failure of intelligence with unreasonable specificity.
          Whether you find that useful is your problem.
        </p>
